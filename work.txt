ToDo:
symbolTable function scope correctly
symbolTable value assignment
type checking
iterative node type
other special node types

I see it as there are 3 kinds of work to be done
symbol table updating
symmantic args/logic checking
AST node creation

symmantic args/logic checking and AST node creation overlap to varying degrees based on the type of node. It is probably better to split the work so that we have sections of productions where one person will do both symmantic checking and AST node creation at the same time.
